## Synopsis

Project Serenity is an interactive experience guiding the player in balancing between fast-paced obstacle navigation, and moments of serenity that delves into the duality of the human psyche between tranquility and stress.

The soundtrack is adapted to the players experience, representing an ethereal delight. Dynamically adapting to the player's journey between the two worlds of serenity and anxiety, where it's aiming to evoke a sense of immersion and profoundness.

Project Serenity predominantly employs a black and white color scheme, with a washed-out white representing the anxiety of light and deep black symbolizing the calming serenity of darkness.

The game presents players with a captivating experience that blends fast-paced gameplay with moments of introspection and serenity in the darkness, enabling the player to explore a refreshing sense of inner peace.
